- Abstract (?)
- Introduction:
    + Explain the paper (contents and scope):
        Without environmental (modifying/interfering) inputs.
    + Sensor definition.
    + Ultrasonic sensor (from curriculum).
    + HCSR04 (from datasheet).
    + Introduce testing system:
        I (cm) ----> HCSR04 ----> O (microsecond)

- Calibration test:
    + Environmental factors:
        ~ Temperature.
        ~ Humidity.
        ~ In-room.
    + Static characteristics:
        ~ IO curve.
        ~ Hysteresis.
        ~ Non-linearity (ignore).
    + Transfer function.
    + Statistics:
        ~ Repeatability.
            + Histogram.
            + Outliers.
        ~ Probability distribution: before and after removing outliers.
- Measurement system:
    + Development board: Arduino Uno, with ATMEGA328P mc.
    + Distance sensing:
        ~ Measure manytimes.
        ~ Process in batch.
        ~ Output a statistic:
            . Mean, after removing outliers.
            . Median, without the need to remove outliers.
    + Display:
        ~ Shift register 74HC595.
        ~ 4 digits 7-segments LED display.
    + Results:
        ~ Code.
        ~ Data.
        ~ Illustrations.
